            <p>I'm Erika Bond and I am an aspiring web designer and programmer. My background is varied; I have experience in art, music, culinary arts, and education. Right now I work as a Business Analyst, but previously I've held positions in both management and in education.</p>
            <p>Currently I am based in Peoria, Arizona, where I live with my husband, step-son, and an elderly grumpy cat. I also have two step-daughters, and my husband and I welcomed our first grandson in August 2018.</p>
            <p>In my (increasingly) spare time, I try to spend time reading and crocheting. I am also a Great British Bake Off junky and cook and bake constantly.</p>
